Hello Welcome, here you can remove your silence from audio files

# Step 1: 

Install the Requirements by using "pip install -r requirements.txt"

# Step 2: 

Run the "Silence-Remove.py 'aggressiveness' <inputfile.wav>" python file. You will get non-silenced audio as "Non-Silenced-Audio.wav".

Set the aggressiveness mode, which is an integer between 0 and 3. 0 is the least aggressive about filtering out non-speech, 3 is the most aggressive.

For Example : "Silence-Remove.py 3 abc.wav"
